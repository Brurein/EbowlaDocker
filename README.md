# Ebowla in Docker

This docker build is a wrapper around this wonderful gem of a project. Too bad it's no longer support. https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla

I liked this bit of software for getting around EDR many moons ago and with the "difficulty" of running Python2 now on modern linux I thought it would be fun to "dockerize" it.

This is the first time I've really looked at docker, I'm sure it could be better... It works for my needs.

#Support
I offer no support, if it doesn't work for you then this probably isn't the solution you want.
